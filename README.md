## Structure of this Course

~~You are to come to class on time and sit quitely until told to speak.~~ 
This course will be taught using a **project-based** approach. During the course we will work on **five fun mini projects** and **one big project** that will go live once completed.

### mini Projects

The mini projects will, at max, take two sessions to complete and will help with the application of what is being taught.

The purpose of the mini projects is to prepare for our final project, the non-profit's website.

#### What will the mini Projects :honeybee:?

Shhh... it's top secret.

Hint: they will be fun!

Project guidelines for each project will be released on GitHub on the day that it is assigned and **one way** of doing the project will be available on GitHub after the due date.

### The BIG Project

There will be one final project.

This is what separates this course from a typical course. Your final project will not be a tough project that I've made up just to test you. Instead you will be **solving an existing problem** for a non-profit by building a website for them based on their needs.
