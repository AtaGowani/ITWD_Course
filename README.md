## Structure of this Course

~~You are to come to class on time and sit quitely until told to speak.~~ 
This course will be taught using a **project based** approach. During the this course we will work on **three fun mini projects** and **one big project** which will go live once completed.

### mini Projects

The mini projects will, at max, take two class periods to complete and will help with the application of what is learned in class.

These mini project are there to help you get ready for the final project.

#### What will the mini Projects :honeybee:?

Shhh... it's top secret.

Hint: they will be fun!

Project guidelines will be released on GitHub on the day they are assigned and one version of the source code will be available after the due date.

### The BIG Project

There will be one final project.

This is what separates this course from a typical course. Your final project will not be a tough project that I've made up just to test you. Instead you will be **solving an existing problem** for a non-profit by building a website for them based on their needs.
