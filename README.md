# Structure of the Class

~~You are to come to class on time and sit quitely until told to speak.~~ 
This class will be taught using a **project based** approach. During the
course of this class we will work on **4 fun projects.** Below is a quick layout of how the projects will be laid out during the 6 weeks of this course.

## 3 mini Projects ##

Three out of the four projects will be mini projects!

These projects will, at max, take 2 class periods to complete and will help with the application of what is learned in class.

## 1 BIG Project ##

There will be one final project.

This project will be build upon through out the course, unlike the mini projects, and will be worked on every class.

## What are the projects? ##

shhh...it's a top secret.

Hint: They will be fun!

Projects will be released on GitHub on the day they are assigned and the source code will be available after due date.
